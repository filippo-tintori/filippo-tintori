## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Filippo!

ðŸŽ“ **Physics Student** at the **University of Perugia**.  
ðŸ”­ Passionate about science, programming, and exploring the mysteries of the universe!  
ðŸ”¬ Working on something crazy? Always. Will it work? Who knows, but itâ€™s going to be fun finding out!  

ðŸ’» I enjoy working with Python, C++, and other languages to solve scientific problems.
